# Tech Blog
My Tech Blog follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. I also use the dotenv package for environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-sessionand connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
